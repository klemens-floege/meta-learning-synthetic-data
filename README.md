# meta-learning-synthetic-data
Use various related data sources to generate synthetic data with the help of LLMs in order to meta-learn some downstream task. In the intial base case we try to replicate the results from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12112.pdf and use LLMs to generate additional data tables for covid patients in Brazil and other countries.
